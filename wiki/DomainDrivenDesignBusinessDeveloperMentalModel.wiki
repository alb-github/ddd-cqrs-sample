#summary Domain Driven Design - Business Developer mental model

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Technical introduction =

This document describes sample code illustrating DDD techniques. Intention is to present code form the perspective of the business model developer. So we focus on business developers' mental model without digging to deep into engine details.

Idea is that Business does not need to understand what's under the hood - he or she should rather focus on modeling and well crafted business code.

==Project Structure==
[http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-sample/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fddd_cqrs-sample SVN Repository] contains project that is structured in the standard Maven way.

===DDD common classes===
Package [http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-sample/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fddd_cqrs-sample%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fpl%2Fcom%2Fbottega%2Fddd pl.com.bottega.ddd] contains common DDD "library".

===CqRS common classes===
Package [http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-sample/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fddd_cqrs-sample%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fpl%2Fcom%2Fbottega%2Fcqrs pl.com.bottega.cqrs] contains common CqRS "engine".

===ERP product classes===
Package [http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-sample/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fddd_cqrs-sample%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fpl%2Fcom%2Fbottega%2Ferp pl.com.bottega.erp] is The Product - Enterprise Resource Planning class system.

System modules separation at this package level:
*crm - Client Relationship Management module
*sagas - Sagas which contains cross module features
*sales - Sales module - *most examples are implemented in this module*
*shipping - Shipping module

Modules are independent set of features that can  be used separately and still being valuable.

In this sample modules are equal do DDD Bounded Context.
